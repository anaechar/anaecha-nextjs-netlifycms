Metamask provides a step-by-step process of creating a wallet; it is easy to follow. However, they did not push the security to the top. I will guide you through additional steps in order to maximize the security of your asset.

## Create a Metamask Wallet

1. Go to [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io)

When the Metamask website is completely loaded, you should check:

* whether there is a lock icon on the address bar or not.
* whether the address is correct or not.

![Lock icon](https://res.cloudinary.com/beforeifly/image/upload/v1629790246/anaecha.com/posts/address-bar-lock_niywrl.jpg "Lock icon")

2. Click "Download", then Click "Chrome", then Click "Install Metamask for Chrome"

3. Click "Add to Chrome"

4. Click on "Create a Wallet"

5. You can click "I Agree" or "No thanks"

6. Enter your password and click "Create"

![Create your password](https://res.cloudinary.com/beforeifly/image/upload/v1629793175/anaecha.com/posts/password_z0rcmy.jpg "Create your password")

7. Click "CLICK HERE TO REVEAL SECRET WORDS", and write down them in paper, then click "Next"

Caution: 

* You should do this step privately. If someone has your secret words, they can fully take control of your account.
* Do not copy and paste in your computer, otherwise hackers can still hack your wallet.
* Do not take a picture of the secret words

8. Click on the secret words in the correct order, then click "Confirm"

9. If the words are in the correct order, you will see "Congratulations" screen.

Actually, the Metamask wallet is created but I recommend the following steps to test the secret recovery phrase (just in case you write down wrong words).

10. Remove Metamask Extension by right click on the Metamask icon and click "Remove from Chrome..."

![Remove from Chrome](https://res.cloudinary.com/beforeifly/image/upload/v1629792362/anaecha.com/posts/remove-from-chrome_uzw8ia.jpg "Remove from Chrome")

11. Add Metamask Extension again by following step number 1-3
12. Now, you have to click on "Import wallet" (instead of create a new wallet)

![Import wallet](https://res.cloudinary.com/beforeifly/image/upload/v1629793909/anaecha.com/posts/import-wallet_km9tar.jpg "Import wallet")

13. Enter the Secret Recovery Phrase and the same or new password, then click "Import"

![Enter Secret Recovery Phrase](https://res.cloudinary.com/beforeifly/image/upload/v1629792255/anaecha.com/posts/enter-secret-recovery-phrase_kwqeho.jpg "Enter Secret Recovery Phrase")

If your Secret Recovery Phrase is correct, the screen will show the success of recovery.

![Congratulations](https://res.cloudinary.com/beforeifly/image/upload/v1629792191/anaecha.com/posts/congrat-recover_sqwk2y.jpg "Congratulations")

Now, your Metamask wallet is successfuly created and the Secret Recovery Phrase is tested.

Congratulations to the Blockchain world !
