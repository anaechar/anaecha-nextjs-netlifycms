## Requirements

1. You need a computer (PC or laptop).
2. You need to install Chrome web browser.
3. You already have set up Trezor with your computer. If you have not done this yet, I wrote about "*[How to set up Trezor Device, The Cold Wallet for Your Crypto](/blog/how-set-up-trezor-device-cold-wallet-crypto)*".

If you have already had Metamask Extension for Chrome, you can skip "Install Metamask Extension" section.
