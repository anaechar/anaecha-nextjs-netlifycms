Metamask is a software wallet (hot wallet). Private Key, Public Key, Coins, NFTs and all of the assets are kept inside the software which is connected to the internet world. Fortunatly, it can be hacked. This is one of the Metamask weakness.

However, Metamask allows us to link our hardware wallets, Trezor and Ledger. This creates another layer of security as Signing process will be done with external device (wallet).

Before going further, let's take a look at the requirements.

## Requirements

1. You need a computer (PC or laptop).
2. You need to install Chrome web browser.
3. You already have set up Trezor with your computer. If you have not done this yet, you can follow my post on "*[How to set up Trezor Device, The Cold Wallet for Your Crypto](/blog/how-set-up-trezor-device-cold-wallet-crypto)*".

If you have already had Metamask Extension for Chrome, you can skip "Install Metamask Extension" section.
