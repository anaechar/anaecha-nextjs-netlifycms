Metamask wallets got hacked every day due to a lack of security knowledge. It is even harder to secure your wallet for those who are not tech savvy. In this post, I will tell you how to improve the Metamask security.

I use Chrome web browser to guide you through the process. It has the same concept with other tools.

## 1. Create a clean wallet

* Make sure you have a clean PC by scaning for virus and malware regularly.
* Make sure you install Chrome from the official site.
* Make sure Autofill password function is disable.
* Make sure you do not have suspicious Chrome Extensions installed, some extensions can access your clipboard which means when you copy your secret code, they can have them too.
* Make sure you do create a wallet privately

You can see my post on "*[How to Properly Create a Metamask Wallet with Chrome](/blog/how-to-properly-create-metamask-wallet)*".

## 2. Store Secret Recovery Phrase

* I recommend you to test your written ones, just after the wallet is created.
* I recommend you to write down on two papers and keep them in different safe places.

## 3. Build Good habits while using Metamask

* Beware of suspicious Chrome Extensions. They can pop up a fake Metamask window and steal your copied secrets in clipboard. You may create a new Chrome profile which have no extensions.
* Close unneccessary tabs while doing transactions
* Always check transaction information i.g. wallet addresses
* Lock your wallet after completing your transactions

## 4. Link your wallet with Hardware wallet

* Buy a reliable wallet from brands like Trezor and Ledger and link it with Metamask. You can see my post on "*[How to Add Trezor Wallet in Metamask Chrome Extension](/blog/how-to-add-trezor-wallet-metamask-extension)*".

Linking your Metamask wallet with Hardware wallet transfer signing process of transactions to the Hardware device. Although a hacker got your Metamask wallet, they cannot do any things with your Hardware wallet's account.

## 5. Learn more about phishing and scam

Because blockchain technology is new, there will be more and more phishing and scam coming out. You should keep learning about them.

These are 5 tips to improve your Metamask security. Happy surfing the Blockchain world !
