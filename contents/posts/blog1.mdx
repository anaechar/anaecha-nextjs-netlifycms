title: Building Anaecha.com Part 1
---

## Create Github Repositories
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click on "New" button to create a new repository
3. Enter a repository name
4. Select "Public" or "Private"
5. Click on "Create repository" button

## Create Next.Js App
1. Run this command (app-name can be changed.)
```
npx create-next-app app-name
```
This will create a folder named "app-name".

If you already have a folder, you can run this command instead while you are in the folder.
```
npx create-next-app .
```

Now, you can test your site with this command.
```
npm run dev
```
Visit your site at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

2. We will start with fresh and clean project. So, we will delete some files.

Delete "Home.module.css"
```
- styles
    - Home.module.css
```

Delete "vercel.svg"
```
- public
    - vercel.svg
```

Delete "Hello.js"
```
- pages
  - api
    - hello.js
```

## First push to the github repository
Run these commands (replace your-github-url)
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin your-github-url
git push -u origin main
```
If you are already in another github remote, run this command to change github remote (replace your-github/your-github-remote with yours). otherwise, you will get an error.
```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-github/your-github-remote
```
To confirm the remote, you can run this command.
```
git remote -v
```

## Publish via Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel site](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click on "New Project" button
3. Click on "Import" from the repository
4. Click on "Skip" to build a team
5. Click on "Deploy"
6. Copy URL path to the site

## Introduce Netlify CMS
1. Create "admin" folder inside "public"
```
- public
    - admin
```

2. Create "index.html" file 
```
- public
    - admin
        - index.html
```
and place the code below
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Content Manager</title>
  <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Netlify CMS -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Create "config.yml"
