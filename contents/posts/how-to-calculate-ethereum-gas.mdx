Let's imagine the bus stop with crowds of people. The bus is blockchain. The miner is a driver. The people are transactions. Priority to get on board is based on bidding. People who want to get on board first, must pay a largest amount of money to the driver for Gas fees.

Ethereum transactions require fees to be proceeded. In the Ethereum world, the fees are called "Gas". It will be charged by Miners in order to process transactions. 

## Amount of Gas Required

The amount of Gas required for each transactions depends on complexity of the transactions. The simple one might be 21,000 gas and the complex one might be 1,000,000 gas.

## Gas Price

The Gas price is fluctuated all the times depending on the amount of traffic. When there are tons of demand at the same time, the price increases.

The real-time price can be checked on websites i.g. [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) and [ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info) and also The history of gas price can be found on [gasnow.org](https://www.gasnow.org)[](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/).

## Transaction Cost

The Transaction Cost can be calculated by this formula:

Transaction Cost = Gas Required * Gas Price
