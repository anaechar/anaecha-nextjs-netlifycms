Lightshine was the project that I participated in the 6th Game Jam from [The Sandbox Game](https://www.sandbox.game) (TSB). Participants needed to use a software called "Game Maker" to build a game. This game jam's theme was "Beast Quest" that came from a TSB's partnership named [Beast Quest](https://beast-quest.com). 

All participants had 14 days to accomplish their games. It started on September 6th to September 19th following by 14 days of voting.

This project took about 150 hours to finish including planning, designing, building, making logics and testing. Every corner of the game was optimized for best camera angles and computer performance. A large number testing and bug fixing were also done for best players' experience.

I had learned and revised knowledge in many aspects: Story Telling, Color Harmony, Game Design, Level Design and Video editing.

I hope that everyone who play this game will have fun and get best experience.
